Being in the present as a fabricator, what am i trying to learn?

Fabricating a new mindset, 
being uncomfortable when creating something outside my comfort zone comes from the fear of graphic design boundaries, creating purely to please others and to make 
something that everybody likes, rather than creating to learn, experience, and grow my identity as a fabricator. 

its time to let go; embrace, fail, succeed, fail again, and start assembling my entity as a designer.
