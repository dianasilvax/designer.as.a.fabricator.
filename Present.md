Being in the present as a fabricator, what am i trying to learn? 

Fabricating a new mindset, skills, entity.
being uncomfortable when creating something outside my comfort zone comes from the fear of graphic design boundaries, 
creating purely to please others and to make something that everybody likes, 
rather than creating to learn, experience, and grow my identity as a fabricator

Learning from the past, and stepping into a new program head first.
progress is not linear, and although it was scary to jump into something new, I intended to make designs for my own personal gratification. 
and that's exactly what i did this week.
