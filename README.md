# Design as a fabricator âœŽ

What does design mean? how am i a fabricator? what is a fabricator?

As a graphic designer i feel like i constantly need to keep up with trends, learn new skills, make myself more 'desirable'as a graphic designer to stand out.

This project is all about developing identity and endulging and emmersing myself in creating something truly fulfilling.
designing as a fabricator by assimilating my identity.

## My end goals;

- convey a clear message about my journey.
- test the meaninfulness of making designs.
