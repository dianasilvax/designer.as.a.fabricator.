# Design as a fabricator âœŽ

What does design mean? how am i a fabricator? what is a fabricator?

As a graphic designer i feel like i constantly need to keep up with trends, learn new skills, make myself more 'desirable'as a graphic designer to stand out.

This project is based around the idea of developing my identity and endulging/emmersing myself in creating something truly fulfilling.
